👋 Hey there Beta friends!





This week, FlowDeck 0.43.0 ships with more improvements across the board.





**📱 Improved Device Builds**



Running and debugging on iPhone or iPad is faster and more stable.  FlowDeck now uses Apple’s official tools (*devicectl) *to connect, install and launch your app on iOS and iPadOS





**⚒️ Build & Run Shortcuts**



Can’t remember all VSCode commands?. You can now build, run, debug, and test your apps right from FlowDeck’s scheme panel.  Everything is one click away!.   (Plus, you get shortcut hints 😉)









🚫  Non-Swift build errors, properly surfaced



Non-swift build errors and warnings now appear in VSCode’s Problems view.  This includes linker errors, clang errors, certificate issues, and much more. – No more log sleuthing required!.









⌨️ Xcode Keyboard Shortcuts



Your muscle memory is safe. FlowDeck can automatically setup your favorite Xcode shortcuts in VSCode.





If you’re coming from XCode, FlowDeck can automatically set up the most common shortcuts for you, so you feel at home.






Open VSCode Command Palette: `Cmd+Shift+P`



Search for “Setup Xcode-style Keyboard Shortcuts”




You can also enable or disable this via FlowDeck Settings in `Extensions > FlowDeck > System Configuration`





Check out the full list of supported shortcuts in [the docs](https://docs.flowdeck.studio/shortcuts/xcode-style-shortcuts)





Thank you all for the feedback.   Keep it coming!
