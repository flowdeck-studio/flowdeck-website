👋 Hey there tinkerers!





Another week, another update, and it’s a big one this time! 





**📦 Full Swift Package Manager Support**



You can now view your project’s packages, update to the latest version, and reset package caches using the new Dependencies panel.





**Add and remove packages coming really soon!**









⚡** Log View improvements**



Better parsing and performance improvements to the OSLog viewer, for those who live inside OSLog. Log streaming is now real-time!





🐜** Bugfixes all around**



Dozens of bugfixes including display issues, scheme selection, improved shortcuts response, and more.





Thank you all for the feedback.   Keep it coming!
