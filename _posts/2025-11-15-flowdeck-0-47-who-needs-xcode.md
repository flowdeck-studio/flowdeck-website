👋 Hey there fellow testers!





Major update this week and so many things coming up with 0.47.0.  Are you sitting down?  Here we go…





 📦 Add and remove Swift Packages



As promised, you can now add and remove Swift Packages from your project, right from Cursor!  Just go to the Package Dependencies panel, and hit the ‘+’ button.  FlowDeck will guide you through the process.









🖼️ Asset Catalog Explorer



Tired of opening Xcode to find an image in some Asset Catalog? You can now browse Asset Catalogs directly in Cursor. Right click the folder, click Open Asset Catalog.





You can browse:






Color Assets



Image Assets (png, jpg, svg, pdf)



App Icons



Variants (Any, Light, Dark)




Editing assets will be available soon.









📁 Projects in Subfolders



Going Monorepo? Just open your root folder in Cursor. Flowdeck will search and discover you iOS and macOS apps up to 4 levels down, so you can tinker with the frontend backend and mobile apps all at once.





🐜 Bugfixes as usual



Dozens of bugfixes including error display improvements, performance issues with package and project discovery and more





Thank you all for the feedback.   Keep it coming!
