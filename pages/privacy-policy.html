                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>FlowDeck ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use FlowDeck CLI and the FlowDeck Extension.</p>
                <p><strong>The short version:</strong> We don't collect, store, or share your personal data. FlowDeck runs entirely on your machine.</p>

                <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
                <p>FlowDeck does not collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal information (name, email, address)</li>
                    <li>Usage analytics or telemetry</li>

            <section class="legal-section">
                <h2>Local Processing Only</h2>
                <p>All FlowDeck operations run locally on your machine. Your code, builds, and data never leave your computer through our software. We have no servers collecting information about your usage.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="legal-section">
                <h2>License Validation</h2>
                <p>When you activate a FlowDeck license, minimal information is exchanged with our license server (powered by Lemon Squeezy) to validate your license key. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your license key</li>
                    <li>A machine identifier (to enforce the 2-machine limit)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No personal data beyond what you provided during purchase is collected or stored by us.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="legal-section">
                <h2>Website Analytics</h2>
                <p>Our website (flowdeck.studio) uses Google Analytics to understand how visitors find and use our site. This is standard website analytics and does not track your use of the FlowDeck software itself. You can opt out of Google Analytics using browser extensions or privacy tools.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="legal-section">
                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lemon Squeezy:</strong> Payment processing and license management. Their privacy policy applies to purchase transactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Website analytics only (not in-app).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="legal-section">
                <h2>Your Rights (GDPR)</h2>
                <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access any personal data we hold about you</li>
                    <li>Request correction or deletion of your data</li>
                    <li>Object to processing of your data</li>
                    <li>Data portability</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since we don't collect personal data through FlowDeck software, these rights primarily apply to any information you provided during purchase (handled by Lemon Squeezy) or if you contacted our support.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="legal-section">
                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <p>We retain purchase records and license information as required for business and legal purposes. If you request deletion of your data, we will comply within 30 days, except where we're legally required to retain certain records.</p>
